# Calculator_Spyware
A remote spyware disguised as calculator

When first opening up the calculator program, it appears to be a simple calculator. However it is also streaming what's displayed to the monitor to a remote server behind the scene, allowing malicious user to spy on the usage of the computer. Simultaneously, it is recording the keyboard input and sending the data to a specific email.

The application is written in C# and the project made using Visual Studio 2013.
